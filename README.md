## Studies

This repo is simply a way for me to keep my course material organized across multiple machines. 

Feel free to look around but some of this is just silly practice stuff.

### The course

The course is through [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). It is a course where I will earn a Microsoft certification.

### My FCC profile

If you'd like to check out what I've been doing, here is a [link to my profile on freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/AndreaRene) where you can see any other certificates I earn and whatever challenges I had to complete to get there.

Currently you will see a certificate called Scientific Computing with Python along with links to multiple challenges I completed to earn it.
